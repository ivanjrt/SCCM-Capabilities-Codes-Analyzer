# SCCM Capabilities Code Analyzer.
Tool Objective: 🧐 This application is designed to retrieve SCCM Capabilities codes from the SCCM Client on Windows devices. <br/>
The database containing these codes has been compiled from various <a href="https://msendpointmgr.com/2023/02/04/co-management-workloads-capabilities">MVPs</a> <br/><br/>

Use this with a grain of salt, AS-IS basics as I don't take any responsability for accuracy or missleading information using this App. <br/>

or<br/>
2 - You can always opt to not use my tool 🙂<br/>

* Due to the fact that I don't have money to buy my own _Code Signing Certificate_ you will 💯 recieve this the first time you run the app<br/>
